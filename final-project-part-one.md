## Project Outline and Summary 

### Art for All Ages - Why Art Organizations Should Create Programs for the Aging Population in The Bay Area

The demographics of the U.S. are undergoing a transformation, with the aging population growing significantly. In 2023, all baby boomers had reached the age of 65, meaning that one in five Americans are at retirement age. Just a few years ahead of us, in 2034, the number of older adults is projected to outnumber children for the first time in U.S. history (Census, “Population Projections”). The Bay Area is aging even faster than the nation as a whole. Between 2012 and 2022, the median age in every Bay Area county rose more than the national average(Nickerson, "Every Bay Area County"). California now has the highest number of residents aged 65 and older in the U.S., highlighting the need to address the challenges and seize the opportunities associated with an aging population.

In the arts sector, many organizations have embraced Diversity, Equity, Accessibility, and Inclusion (DEAI) initiatives to create welcoming environments. However, programs that are designed to empower older adults to engage with art and enhance their mental and physical well-being while challenging stereotypes about aging are still widely developed. According to Culture Track, the top five life priorities for people over 55 include having fun, seeking social connection, enjoying humor, and finding calm and stability. And the desire for meaningful social connections intensifies with age, often fulfilled through active participation and engagement in new cultural experiences. (Culture Track, “Untapped Opportunity”).

Art organizations have long been spaces for cultural participation, with little generational variation in motivators for engaging with the arts across Millennials, Gen X, Baby Boomers, and Pre-War generations (Culture Track, “CT2017-Top-Line-Report”). Despite this, art programs often offer immersive experiences or educational activities that cater to the younger generations. Unfortunately, few programs address lifelong learning or support the overall well-being of older adults. There are nearly 30 art museums in the Bay Area. However, only one museum offers a program designed specifically for the elderly. As the Bay Area’s population ages, it is time for art organizations to embrace this demographic change and create more inclusive spaces that address the needs of older adults and support their well-being.

## Data Resources 

- “Arts Participation Patterns in 2022: Highlights from the Survey of Public Participation in the Arts.” National Endowment for the Arts. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://www.arts.gov/impact/research/publications/arts-participation-patterns-2022-highlights-survey-public-participation-arts. 

This data source provides a national overview of public participation in the arts in 2022, focusing on how adults engage with various forms of art. This report gives a broader exploration of the different types of art consumption that can help me explain the various types of art activities that aging adults might need rather than focusing on one kind of art organization or activity. One particularly useful piece of data that I will focus on is the role of digital media in engagement. As Figure 1 highlights, 75% of adults participated in the arts through digital platforms, suggesting that social media and online tools could be powerful platforms for connecting aging adults with art experiences.


- “CT2017-Top-Line-Report.Pdf - Culture Track.” Culture Track. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CT2017-Top-Line-Report.pdf. 

This resource offers data and information on defining cultural activities and the key motivators for participation. One data set I plan to use is the data showing the motivators for cultural participation across the four generational groups: Millennials, Gen X, Baby Boomers, and the Pre-War generation.


- Dattani, Saloni, Lucas Rodés-Guirao, Hannah Ritchie, Esteban Ortiz-Ospina, and Max Roser. “Life Expectancy.” Our World in Data, December 28, 2023. https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy. 

I will use this data to open the story and show that people live longer. 


- “Museums and Creative Aging:” American Alliance of Museums. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://www.aam-us.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/2021_Museums-and-Creative-Aging_A-Healthful-Partnership.pdf. 

This article provides a comprehensive analysis of demographic shifts, the impact of ageism, and the role of arts in promoting mental and physical health for older adults. I plan to use this article as a basic guide and a case study for the Resolution part, using data found from other sites to support the analysis.


- Nickerson , Scooty, Harriet Rowan , and Bay Area News Group. “Every Bay Area County Is Aging Faster than the U.S.” Silicon Valley.Com, June 23, 2023. https://www.siliconvalley.com/2023/06/23/every-bay-area-county-is-aging-faster-than-the-u-s/. 

This article shows data on the accelerated aging of the population in the Bay Area counties. I will use this piece to illustrate the importance of the Bay Area aging issue and how the aging population is relevant to the statement of this project.


- “Population Projections for 2020 to 2060.” Census.gov, 2020. https://www.census.gov/content/dam/Census/library/publications/2020/demo/p25-1144.pdf. 

This report will serve as a primary source for citing national population data. The truthfulness of the Census data can add credibility to my article and help set an overarching reference point to support the discussion.


- “Prime Time | Moma.” MoMA. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://www.moma.org/calendar/programs/63. 

This source can be used as a case study and example of an art organization’s effort in supporting aging adults.


- “Supporting Data | Culture Track.” Culture Track. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/CT17_Supporting_Data.pdf. 

This is the complete 2017 Culture Track report, which includes all the survey questions asked to the respondents about cultural engagement. I plan to focus on the sections “Motivators and Barriers to Participation” and “Perception of Cultural Activities by Generation” to explore the differences and similarities in how different generations engage with art. Thiswill help build a strong case and statement for why and how art organizations should prioritize participation across all age groups.


- “Untapped Opportunity: Older Americans & the Arts.” Culture Track. Accessed November 18, 2024. https://s28475.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/CCTTUntappedOpportunity.pdf. 

This report complements the AAM “Museums and Creative Aging” analysis perfectly. This report includes rich datasets and great data visualization examples. I plan to use its data to support the AAM analysis, particularly in the call-to-action section. Toward the end, the report also touches on social issues like systemic racism. I am still considering how and where to incorporate this information, as it could be crucial to highlight why art organizations have not widely included aging adults in their programs or addressed racism with the same urgency as other equity issues.
