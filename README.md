This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU in Fall 2024 Mini2

# About Me :smile:
My name is Di Liu (she/her), and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU. I studied art history during my undergraduate and am now pursuing a degree with a stronger business focus in the arts. Before coming to CMU, I worked in an art gallery in Palo Alto, California. Being at the heart of Silicon Valley exposed me to interdisciplinary artists who integrate technology and data into their work. Interacting with them made me realize how understanding data and visualization can offer fresh perspectives on art. One interdisciplinary artist I like is Leo Villareal. He combines LED lights and programmed codes to create ever-changing illuminated displays. His work shows a harmony between technology that transforms simple coding into mesmerizing data visualization patterns.

I am also a Disney adult. I enjoy visiting the parks to experience the food and the latest rides and sharing tips and tricks online. I run a Disney-themed blog to help first-time visitors get familiar with Disneyland and make the most of their trips.

# What I Hope to Learn :writing_hand:
A few years ago, a gallery client recommended the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I briefly read for an art event. Although I was intrigued by the concepts, I did not have the chance to finish it. When I saw that CMU offered a course called Telling Stories with Data, I knew I had to take it to deepen my understanding of data visualization. At CMU, almost every course involved some form of data analysis. As someone from a visual arts background, I am interested in learning the logical concepts behind data to help me communicate in business settings and build the skills to create visually pleasing and flawless graphics.
