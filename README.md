This is my public portfolio for Telling Stories with Data at CMU in Fall 2024 Mini2

# About Me :smile:
My name is Di Liu (she/her), and I am a second-year Master of Arts Management student at CMU. I studied art history during my undergraduate and am now pursuing a degree with a stronger business focus in the arts. Before coming to CMU, I worked in an art gallery in Palo Alto, California. Being at the heart of Silicon Valley exposed me to interdisciplinary artists who integrate technology and data into their work. Interacting with them made me realize how understanding data and visualization can offer fresh perspectives on art. One interdisciplinary artist I like is Leo Villareal. He combines LED lights and programmed codes to create ever-changing illuminated displays. His work shows a harmony between technology that transforms simple coding into mesmerizing data visualization patterns.

I am also a Disney adult. I enjoy visiting the parks to experience the food and the latest rides and sharing tips and tricks online. I run a Disney-themed blog to help first-time visitors get familiar with Disneyland and make the most of their trips.

# What I Hope to Learn :writing_hand:
A few years ago, a gallery client recommended the book _Storytelling with Data_, which I briefly read for an art event. Although I was intrigued by the concepts, I did not have the chance to finish it. When I saw that CMU offered a course called Telling Stories with Data, I knew I had to take it to deepen my understanding of data visualization. At CMU, almost every course involved some form of data analysis. As someone from a visual arts background, I am interested in learning the logical concepts behind data to help me communicate in business settings and build the skills to create visually pleasing and flawless graphics.

Here is my portfolio, I hope you enjoy reading it through.

The heatmap visualization provides a more comprehensive view of the dataset. It captured detailed information across all available countries and years. While this data visualization can be helpful for people seeking to explore the full range of debt data, it lacks a clear emphasis on a specific story/message. At first glance, the data looks cluttered and overwhelming. A good aspect of this data visualization is the choice of orange and blue colors that align well with neurological conventions. [^1]

In the third graph, I used a subset of 2023 data of the general government debt. The original dataset included 29 countries, and I want to focus on the countries with debt exceeding 100% of GDP. By removing unnecessary data from the visualization, I can present the intended message more clearly. 

I chose to highlight Greece, which has the highest debt ratio compared to the other countries in the dataset. Unlike the title of the heatmap, which reiterates what the data is showing (structure),[^2] I wrote the title for the third graph as “Greece Ranking First Among Countries with Government Gross Debt Exceeding 100% of GDP in 2023” to convey the key insight into Greece's particularly high debt level. 

To make Greece stand out and draw attention to its high debt, I used a contrasting color to help immediately guide the readers' eye to the prominent bar. Since the dataset indicates debt (bad), using red color would follow neurological conventions. The heatmap from above also presents a similar idea, where higher debt is indicated with more intense red shading. Knowing that the left upper area is usually how readers start scanning the page, placing the emphasized information in this area can direct the readers to absorb the intended information quickly. For this reason, I made the title to emphasize Greece’s ranking first at the beginning of the sentence.
