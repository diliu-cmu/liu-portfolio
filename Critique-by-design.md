## Step One
### How Do People Spend Their Time

## Step Two: Evaluation of the Graph

### What stood out: 
Completeness of the Data: The graph appears to be complete, which makes it valuable for audiences interested in specific aspects of time use, such as work hours or leisure across different countries. The graph also provides enough details for people seeking detailed and country-specific information. 
Aesthetics: The choice of a stacked bar chart with various colors immediately captures my attention. This graph type often shows proportions, makes comparisons, and is easier to follow. The designer also uses colors that align with neurological conventions.
Engaging Title: The title is engaging and invites viewers to explore the chart further, sparking interest in the time-use patterns it presents.
Eye Candy: The graph is very crowded, with all the labels, lines, categories, and colors. 

### What did you find worked really well?
Choice of the Graph and Intuitiveness: The colorful stacked bar chart is great for showing proportions and making comparisons, which enhances the intuitiveness of the graph. The graph design is a familiar format for a broad audience, making it easy for them to dive into the data points quickly and understand the information at a glance.
Completeness and Truthfulness: The graph scored high in completeness and truthfulness. The graph provides a comprehensive look at the daily activities across major countries. Each category is labeled in minutes for precise information. From the sleep variable, we can tell that the graph is relatively valid and reflects the realistic average human sleep time (between 8-9 hours). There are no countries that have extreme values of sleep or another variable that might raise questions about the data’s validity. 

### What didn't work out 
Inconsistent Labeling of Time Units: The time spent on each category is measured inconsistently. “Sleep” is shown in hours, while other categories are in minutes. This confuses the perceptibility of the audience.
Overly Busy Layout: The layout is overwhelming, with abundant colors, labels, and lines. This graph has the "eye candy" effect. Although this might be purposely created due to the aim of completeness and perceptibility qualities, it lacks the actual usefulness for the variables to be comparative and not straightforwardly laid on the graph. 

### What, if anything, would you do differently?  
Grouping the related variables and renaming them can help to reduce overcrowding. For example, merge “Paid Work” and “Education” into a single category as “Paid Work & Education.” “TV & Radio,” “Seeing Friends,” and “Other Leisure” as “Total Leisure.” “Housework & Shopping,” “Unpaid Work”  as “Community & Family Activities.” “Personal Care” and “Eating & Drinking” as “Necessities.”
Convert sleep time to minutes to align with the labeling of other variables across the chart.

### Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?
Primary audience: The audience includes those with a general curiosity about lifestyle trends across countries and people considering lifestyle changes. Given that the data is ranked by "Paid Work" from highest to lowest, the primary audience will likely be those who are evaluating their current living situation and work-life balance and exploring options of changing their lifestyle or relocating to their preferred country that aligns with their living conditions and interests.
I don’t think this visualization effectively reaches its primary audience because it lacks a clear focus and narrative. While I ranked the graph with a high completeness score, it does include unnecessary information, such as the “Sleep” variable. Since there is less significant variation in sleep across the countries listed, this data is not particularly impactful compared to the rest of the variables and can be removed. 

### Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)
The Stephen Few's method* was effective because it enabled me to analyze the visualization from my personal perspective and the audience's point of view. Understanding the target audience allows for a more accurate critique that goes beyond basic aesthetics like color and font size. The seven critique criteria make the evaluation more balanced and objective. However, some elements are missing, such as how the audience's eye movement navigates the graph. Additionally, the criteria overlook the impact of controlled color usage on accessibility and perceptibility. Few's emphasis on graph completeness could potentially lead to information overload, making the graph harder for the audience to interpret—even if they are familiar with the content and graph type.

## Step three: Sketch out a Solution

## Step four: Test the Solution

Based on the above evaluation, I identified that my audience is a niche, specific people from or living in countries with higher-paid work hours. 
I have a few ideas for the solution: 1) I want to make the graph interactive, allowing users to hover for additional information. 2) I want to make the graph less overwhelming and remove the redundant and unnecessary variables, such as "Sleep." 3) Since "Sleep" is fairly consistent across countries, I will remove "Sleep" from the visual display and include the average sleep minutes as descriptive information in the subtitle. 4) Work with different graph types. My idea is to create an engaging story for a broad audience, especially for those with less time invested in reading and analyzing but interested in comparing lifestyles. So, the graph needs to be familiar and easy to understand.

### User Interviews
User Interview Feedback: Round 1
Student 1
A question came up about why I selected only three countries. I explained these were representative samples chosen for their distinct lifestyles. This feedback made me realize I may be making assumptions about the countries rather than accurately reflecting the data. To address this, I added a second redesign. A world map shows people's average time outside paid work across various regions, aiming to provide a more complete and nuanced view.

User Interview Feedback: Round 2
Student 2
Marketing Savvy
Positive Feedback: They liked the combination of graphs, which kept them engaged and allowed them to explore distinct lifestyles from each region. They also find the topic fun to explore.
Suggestions for Improvement: They suggested to me that colors across both graphs should be somewhat similar. The darker color implies something more serious. While this darker hue logically reflects the non-work time data accuracy, it does not align with the positive nature of non-work activities. They also suggested I rethink the color scheme for Graph 1 and ensure consistency in color by country rather than by category.
