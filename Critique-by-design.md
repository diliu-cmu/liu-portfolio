With increasing stress from long work hours in China and South Korea, many people from these countries are considering relocation options. Personally, I am curious about how people in different countries spend their time each day. When I came across this article, I was immediately drawn to the colorful bar chart and detailed labels. I appreciate the information presented, and this chart seems to offer valuable insights worth exploring.

## Step Two: Evaluation of the Graph

### Scale: 

Usefulness: 4

Completeness: 8

Perceptibility: 7

Truthfulness: 8

Intuitiveness: 7

Aesthetics: 3

Engagement: 3

### What stood out: 
Completeness of the Data: The graph appears to be complete, which makes it valuable for audiences interested in specific aspects of time use, such as work hours or leisure across different countries. The graph also provides enough details for people seeking detailed and country-specific information. 
Aesthetics: The choice of a stacked bar chart with various colors immediately captures my attention. This graph type often shows proportions, makes comparisons, and is easier to follow. The designer also uses colors that align with neurological conventions.
Engaging Title: The title is engaging and invites viewers to explore the chart further, sparking interest in the time-use patterns it presents.
Eye Candy: The graph is very crowded, with all the labels, lines, categories, and colors. 

### What did you find worked really well?
Choice of the Graph and Intuitiveness: The colorful stacked bar chart is great for showing proportions and making comparisons, which enhances the intuitiveness of the graph. The graph design is a familiar format for a broad audience, making it easy for them to dive into the data points quickly and understand the information at a glance.
Completeness and Truthfulness: The graph scored high in completeness and truthfulness. The graph provides a comprehensive look at the daily activities across major countries. Each category is labeled in minutes for precise information. From the sleep variable, we can tell that the graph is relatively valid and reflects the realistic average human sleep time (between 8-9 hours). There are no countries that have extreme values of sleep or another variable that might raise questions about the data’s validity. 

### What didn't work out 
Inconsistent Labeling of Time Units: The time spent on each category is measured inconsistently. “Sleep” is shown in hours, while other categories are in minutes. This confuses the perceptibility of the audience.
Overly Busy Layout: The layout is overwhelming, with abundant colors, labels, and lines. This graph has the "eye candy" effect. Although this might be purposely created due to the aim of completeness and perceptibility qualities, it lacks the actual usefulness for the variables to be comparative and not straightforwardly laid on the graph. 

### What, if anything, would you do differently?  
Grouping the related variables and renaming them can help to reduce overcrowding. For example, merge “Paid Work” and “Education” into a single category as “Paid Work & Education.” “TV & Radio,” “Seeing Friends,” and “Other Leisure” as “Total Leisure.” “Housework & Shopping,” “Unpaid Work”  as “Community & Family Activities.” “Personal Care” and “Eating & Drinking” as “Necessities.”
Convert sleep time to minutes to align with the labeling of other variables across the chart.

### Who is the primary audience for this tool?  Do you think this visualization is effective for reaching that audience?  Why or why not?
Primary audience: The audience includes those with a general curiosity about lifestyle trends across countries and people considering lifestyle changes. Given that the data is ranked by "Paid Work" from highest to lowest, the primary audience will likely be those who are evaluating their current living situation and work-life balance and exploring options of changing their lifestyle or relocating to their preferred country that aligns with their living conditions and interests.
I don’t think this visualization effectively reaches its primary audience because it lacks a clear focus and narrative. While I ranked the graph with a high completeness score, it does include unnecessary information, such as the “Sleep” variable. Since there is less significant variation in sleep across the countries listed, this data is not particularly impactful compared to the rest of the variables and can be removed. 

### Final thoughts: how successful what this method at evaluating the data visualization you selected? Are there measures you feel are missing or not being captured here?  What would you change?  Provide 1-2 recommendations (color, type of visualization, layout, etc.)
The Stephen Few's method* was effective because it enabled me to analyze the visualization from my personal perspective and the audience's point of view. Understanding the target audience allows for a more accurate critique that goes beyond basic aesthetics like color and font size. The seven critique criteria make the evaluation more balanced and objective. However, some elements are missing, such as how the audience's eye movement navigates the graph. Additionally, the criteria overlook the impact of controlled color usage on accessibility and perceptibility. Few's emphasis on graph completeness could potentially lead to information overload, making the graph harder for the audience to interpret—even if they are familiar with the content and graph type.

## Step three: Sketch out a Solution

## Step four: Test the Solution

Based on the above evaluation, I identified that my audience is a niche, specifically people from or living in countries with higher-paid work hours. 
I have a few ideas for the solution: 1) I want to make the graph interactive, allowing users to hover for additional information. 2) I want to make the graph less overwhelming and remove the redundant and unnecessary variables, such as "Sleep." 3) Since "Sleep" is fairly consistent across countries, I will remove "Sleep" from the visual display and include the average sleep minutes as descriptive information in the subtitle. 4) Work with different graph types. My idea is to create an engaging story for a broad audience, especially for those with less time invested in reading and analyzing but interested in comparing lifestyles. So, the graph needs to be familiar and easy to understand.

### User Interviews
#### User Interview Feedback: Round 1
Student 1

A question came up about why I selected only three countries. I explained these were representative samples chosen for their distinct lifestyles. This feedback made me realize I may be making assumptions about the countries rather than accurately reflecting the data. To address this, I added a second redesign. A world map shows people's average time outside paid work across various regions, aiming to provide a more complete and nuanced view.

#### User Interview Feedback: Round 2
Student 2

Marketing Savvy

Positive Feedback: They liked the combination of graphs, which kept them engaged and allowed them to explore distinct lifestyles from each region. They also find the topic fun to explore.

Suggestions for Improvement: They suggested to me that colors across both graphs should be somewhat similar. The darker color implies something more serious. While this darker hue logically reflects the non-work time data accuracy, it does not align with the positive nature of non-work activities. They also suggested I rethink the color scheme for Graph 1 and ensure consistency in color by country rather than by category.

## Step five: Build your solution

I liked the idea of incorporating GDP per capita, but since my graph is meant for a broad audience, I decided to not use economic terms that might overwhelm some audience. After all, the goal is for this graph to be engaging, fun, and informative.



I started by redesigning the bar graph, which carries the core information. Initially, I selected three countries to represent each region’s paid work time, Leisure, and Life Necessities comparison. However, even with a new color scheme, the graph felt incomplete with such a limited dataset. Listing all countries would clutter the graph, so I grouped them by region instead. This approach provided a more complete picture by comparing each region’s non-work and work time. Although the side-by-side bar format presented a comparison, it required viewers to analyze the data themselves. I wanted to minimize this effort for them. My goal is to provide a direct answer to the audience. For my story, it is about showing people where they might want to move for more personal time and freedom. Given the limited data from my original dataset, I used Tableau’s calculation function to create a work-to-non-work time ratio (non work time divided by the sum of non work time and work time), which is more precise than simply showing average non-work time. I selected the top 10 countries with the highest work-to-non-work time ratio for the audience. As expected, many European countries and Australia made the list. This result aligns with the common perception that European countries tend to have a less stressful paid work life and a more balanced lifestyle.

In the map, I combined all non-paid work activities from the original dataset into a single 'Non-Work' category. The size of each circle represents the average minutes people spend on non-work activities in each region.

Design Adjustments: In terms of design, I realized the gray color scheme did not work well, as it blended with the gray map background. I imagined my audience coming to this graph after a long day, seeking a fresh perspective on a lifestyle for the future. Bright, colorful dots and bars could capture their attention and encourage them to engage a bit longer. The different circle sizes offer an intuitive way to interpret the data, and I added the numbers to provide additional context for those who prefer a quick overview. Because the two graphs are related, I want the bar graph's color to carry a cohesive color scheme as the map. Each country in the bar graph is color-coded according to its region, matching the colors shown on the map.
