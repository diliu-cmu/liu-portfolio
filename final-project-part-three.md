# Changes Made Since Part One


## The audience
The first draft I set my audience as the art administraos but did not sepecify a region. As the story develop, the targetet audience became narrower, they are the Bay Area art administros from all visual arts institutions. This groups includes, aer educations, program staff, development officers, and other art advocate in area. The Call to action has some resources targeted to the Bay Area support, but I hopee the story could also reach to other part of California, or even nationawide since there are many data that are not tie to just Bay Area.


## Final design decisions

### The Work

The story:

There have been quite a few edits to the story flow since the second draft. I added more evidence to support the central statement and included a case study from Dr. Gen D. Cohen, demonstrating how art can improve overall health among older populations. The additional evidence on social isolation and loneliness as challenges for older adults also makes the story more impactful and emphasizes the need for action. 

To improve narrative clarity, I rearranged the story's structure. The opening now focuses on the broader demographic shifts and explores the potential risks and societal impacts of the increasing aging population. It then zooms in on California and the Bay Area to make the audience compare the region with the bigger picture. 

I intentionally made the story more high-level. It serves as an introduction for art administrators who may not yet have considered the aging population as part of their art programs or might not know much about the aging population's needs in art. There are positive case studies that show the positive outcomes of involving older adults in the arts. I hope this can encourage the audience to evaluate their current programs or develop new initiatives tailored to older adults. 


The design:

- I followed the feedback from the professor and removed the life expectancy graph as it didn’t align with the narrative.
- Based on user feedback, I redesigned the graph "comparing the life priorities of older and younger adults." I separated the desires for "having fun" and "social connection" into two graphs. Each graph highlights its indicated factor. As the reader scrolls down the page, the graphs become like GIFs showing visual distinction.
- "The population of people age 65+ outnumbering children in 2034," I  added a title and improved the labeling for clarity.
- I added a few new graph:
Bay Area Aging Faster than the National Median: To compare county-level data with the national median age, I used a lighter color for the U.S. data to help emphasize local trends.
Risk of Social Isolation Among Older Adults by State: I changed this data from an interactive map into a dot plot. I ranked the states from highest to lowest. I think this format makes identifying trends easier than the map. The original graph grouped values into five color categories, and it can be difficult to see the specific state compared to the rest of the nation.
  
Overall color scheme:

I chose a simple color scheme. Orange is a sunset color, and it can be interpreted as one's later time in life. Yellow often represents brightness and youth, therefore symbolizing younger generations.


Observations: 

Crafting a cohesive story was challenging throughout the process because there was limited data specific to the Bay Area's older population, such as factors influencing social isolation or museum attendance rates. I am passionate about the area since I was part of that art community and saw an opportunity for the local art institutions to better serve the community. There was a local senior center that often organized trips with its senior residents to my art gallery. Although these older adults don't know much about the arts, they had so much fun talking with each other or asking me questions about the exhibition. I wish we could offer more events or just target them. So, I tried to include more relevant California data to help engage the Bay Area's targeted audiences. I hope the final story feels informative and actionable, therefore encouraging museums to consider the broader older adult population rather than limiting programs to a few affluent elderly.
