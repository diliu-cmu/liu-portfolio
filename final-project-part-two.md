# Wireframes and Storyboard

Shorthand Link: 

After creating an initial story outline on my iPad last week, I began developing the writing and data visualizations on Shorthand. As I mentioned in the final project part one page, I envision my Shorthand page acting like a "Pitch Deck" that uses infographics and data visualization to raise awareness and spark interest for art administrators in thinking about the aging population and their participation in the arts.

I have refined my audience focus. I narrowed it down from art administrators across the U.S. to the Bay Area specifically. My target audience now includes program directors, education department managers, and DEI program staff at art museums in the San Francisco Bay Area. Of course, anyone visiting my page can find helpful information about combating ageism in the art and cultural spaces. The goal is to encourage these professionals to rethink how art museums engage with older adults in the current society and continue to create an inclusive environment for all.

Notes after the user interviews: 
Reasons for making the change - Art museums struggle with the decline of museum visitorship, program funding, and providing inclusive space towards older adults.

| Goal         | Questions to Ask | 
|--------------|------------------|
| Understanding the target audience        | Can you identify the target audience of this story - who is the story speaking to?      |
| The clarity of the intent of the story     | Do you understand what the story is about and why it matters? Does this story inspire an interest in change?| 
| Does the data visualization make sense in the story| Do you understand each graph and its interpretation? Does each graph convey trueness, completeness, and perceptibility?                     |
|Design improvement | If the data visualization is not clear in conveying the story (or simply not clear in design), what adjustments and changes would you suggest?|
|Identify missing elements| Are there any gaps in the narrative and data? What would you like to see that is missing in the story?
